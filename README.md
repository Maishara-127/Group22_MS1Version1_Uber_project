# Simulation Uber App 

This project simulates the core functionalities of the Uber App, with a focus on key business operations such as ride management, marketing, system performance, and customer support. The simulation showcases how various user roles collaboratively contribute to the smooth operation and efficient management of the application.

The system includes multiple user roles. But my contribution focused on simulating two key roles:

Marketing Executive– Manages promotional strategies and customer engagement by performing tasks such as:

1. Creating discount codes
2. Updating social media links
3. Scheduling automated social media posts
4. Sending email campaigns
5. Tracking ratings and feedback
6. Promoting new services
7. Monitoring user engagement trends
8. Adjusting the marketing budget

System Administrator– Ensures the app’s technical stability and data integrity through responsibilities like:

1. Checking system uptime
2. Managing user access
3. Displaying registered drivers and passengers
4. Optimizing payment processing
5. Reducing app data consumption
6. Backing up important files
7. Checking app version and updates
8. Reviewing security logs

This project effectively demonstrates how each role within the Uber App ecosystem contributes to delivering a seamless and efficient ride-sharing experience.
